# Lesson 2.1 - Destructuring Assignment

ES2015 comes with a brand new way to assign variables when dealing with arrays
and objects. This new feature is called `destructuring assignment` and it
allows you to easily assign variables from array elements or key/value pairs
for an object. Let's dive right in shall we?

## Array Matching

The first type of destructuring we're going to talk about is array matching.
Put simply, this feature allows you to assign a list of variables to matching
indices in arrays. Let's take a look at this code example so that we can
better see how this works.

```js
> var list = [1, 2, 3]
> var [a, b, c] = list
> console.log(a, b, c)
-> 1 2 3
```

As you can see there, we were able to easily assign three variables, `a`, `b`,
and `c`, to variables that match the indices of the array that we matched.
It is also possible to skip an index when doing this type of assignment.

```js
> var list = [1, 2, 3]
> var [a, ,c] = list
> console.log(a, c)
-> 1 3
```

It's as easy as just not passing in a new variable name at the index that you
would like to skip, and the variable won't be assigned.

## Object Matching

Another great destructuring assignment that is now available to us is object
matching. With object matching we can assign variables in much the same way
that we did using array matching, but in this case we will be matching our
variable names to the object keys, instead of array indices.

```js
> var obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }
> var { a, b, c } = obj
> console.log(a, b, c)
-> 1 2 3
```

As you can see, the syntax differs slightly here in that we're using curly
braces for the destructuring assignment, to match the fact that we are
destructuring on an object. This works equally as well for deeply nested
objects.

```js
> var obj = { a: { b: 1, c: { d: 2 } } }
> var { a: { b, c: { d } } } = obj
> console.log(b, d)
-> 1, 2
```

Now you can very easily extract a value from a deeply nested object using
this new destructuring assignment! This is a great new feature.

We can use these same types of assignments in functions.....

## Parameter Context Matching

Using parameter context matching we can use this same type of destructuring
assignment syntax in the definition of function parameters. Let's take a look
at the following example.

```js
function print({ value }) {
  console.log(value)
}
```

In this example, the `print` function is expecting to receive as an argument,
an object with a key of `value`.

```js
> print({value: "Hello World!"})
-> Hello World!
```


You can also extend this to work in various ways:

```js
> var obj = { value: 'Hello' }
> print(obj)
-> Hello
```

Here we just passed in a predefined object that fits what your function is
looking for. But what if we had a variable named `value`, that already contains
the value that we want to print? ES2015 has something for that too!

```js
> var value = 'Hello World!'
> print({ value })
-> Hello World!
```

That's really powerful and flexible! This allows you to write a lot less code,
and to easily refactor existing code.

You might think that this has all been really amazing, but we're not done yet!
There's one more great feature, and it really puts the cherry on top of
everything we have covered so far.

## Fail Soft Destructuring

When attempting to assign a variable via destructuring, if the indice or object
key does not exist, that variable will simply be `undefined`, instead of
throwing an error. That's not all though, we can actually assign a default
value if we want also! Let's see this in action.

```js
> var list = [1, 2]
> var [a = 10, b = 6, c = 40, d] = list
> console.log(a, b, c, d)
-> 1 2 40 undefined
```

Unfortunately, the default values only currently work for arrays, but at the
very least we will get an undefined variable from an object key that doesn't
exist.

## Moving on...

This has been a great introduction to destructuring assignments in ES2015,
but let's keep moving and see what we can learn about string templates!
