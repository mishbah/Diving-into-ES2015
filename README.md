# Diving into ES2015 - Introduction

Hello, my name is Darin Haener and I'll be helping you dive in and get familiar
with the new JavaScript specification, called ES2015. The specification for
ES2015 was ratified in June of 2015, and is currently being implemented in
browsers.

In this course we'll be covering new features such as parameter destructuring,
template strings, arrow functions, and classes. Some of these new features
are additions to the core of the ECMA script, while others, such as classes
just provide some syntactical sugar on top of old functionality, just to make
things easier to code.

Because support for all of the features has not yet been adopted we will have
to install just a few tools to get going with ES2015. We'll be using the
[Babel CLI](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/cli/) to run the Node REPL, and
really that is about all we will need to get started!

So let's go ahead and get setup so we can start writing some ES2015 code!
