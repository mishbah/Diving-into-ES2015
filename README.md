# Lesson 7.3 - Getters, Setters, and Base Class Access

A couple of interesting things we can do with classes is defining getters
and setters. It looks like this:

```js
class Car {
  constructor(make) {
    this._make = make
  }

  get make() {
    return this._make
  }

  set make(newMake) {
    this._make = newMake
  }
}
```

This is a pretty simple concept and allows us to have som control over some of
the inner workings of our class at the instance level. Let's look at it in action:

```bash
> var car = new Car('Toyota')
> console.log(car.make)
-> Toyota
> car.make = 'Dodge'
> console.log(car.make)
-> 'Dodge'
```

Cool! Let's check out how we can access the base class when using inheritance.

Imagine we have the `Truck` class from the last lesson, and we want to add the
`drive` variable to the `print` method. We can do that pretty easily like this:

```js
print() {
  return `${super.print()} with ${this.drive}`
}
```

What we did there was access the base class with the `super` keyword, and then
call the `print` method from the base class. We used string interpolation to
add this to a new string that includes whether the vehicle is 2WD or 4WD.
That's pretty cool! But again, beware of using this too much, because it
does tightly couple the implementation of the `Truck` class to the implementation
of the `Vehicle` class.

## Moving on
We're moving right along! Let's finish up by talking about how to use static
members!
